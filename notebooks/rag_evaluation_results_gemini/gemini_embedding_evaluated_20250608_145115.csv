1,How is the standard recombination history tested in the Planck 2018 analysis?,"**Answer**:

The Planck 2018 analysis tested the standard recombination history using a semi-blind eigen-analysis, also known as a principal-component analysis. This method expanded deviations of the free-electron fraction from the standard recombination history into 80 redshift bands, spanning from before helium recombination to after hydrogen recombination.

In the Planck 2018 paper, cosmological parameters show shifts between low and high multipole likelihoods.

39,How did CAMELS verify that the autoencoder was actually encoding the structures in the data that were of interest?,"**Answer**:

CAMELS verified that the autoencoder was encoding structures of interest by training it on temperature fields and then testing its reconstruction ability on both temperature fields from different cosmological models and a completely different image (the CAMELS logo). The autoencoder accurately reconstructed temperature fields from varied cosmologies, but showed significantly higher reconstruction errors for non-background parts of the CAMELS logo, indicating it had learned the specific manifold of temperature maps rather than general image compression.

The trained models are not robust because they fail to accurately infer cosmological parameters when tested on galaxies from a different simulation suite than the one they were trained on.

84,Why is there such a large difference between the optical and NIR Wesenheit magnitude systematic errors in the HST paper?,"**Answer**:

The larger systematic error in optical Wesenheit magnitudes compared to NIR counterparts in the HST paper is primarily due to their increased sensitivity to variations in the treatment of reddening, metallicity, period-luminosity (P-L) relation breaks, and outlier rejection. This heightened sensitivity to the reddening law is a natural consequence of the larger R value in the optical.

As N_{idr} approaches zero, the parameter \Gamma_{0, nadm} becomes degenerate, meaning the data cannot distinguish its value. This degeneracy is the fundamental reason for the weaker constraint. The generated answer completely misses this core scientific concept and is therefore fundamentally incorrect.",True,,10.750622034072876
103,"Why does including f\sigma_8 measurements into the calculation of the growth index, associated with a class of modified gravity theories, cause the tension level with GR to increase dramatically?","**Answer**:

Including $f\sigma_8$ measurements in the calculation of the growth index for modified gravity theories increases tension with General Relativity (GR) because these measurements effectively break degeneracies between the growth index ($\gamma$) and other parameters, pushing the constrained value of $\gamma$ away from the GR prediction of 0.55 by more than 3 sigma. This tension is primarily driven by specific low-redshift $f\sigma_8$ data points from redshift-space distortion (RSD) and peculiar velocity surveys.

104,Do the extensions to \lambdaCDM considered in the ACT DR6 paper help to resolve the tension between the ACT DR6 measurement of H_0 and the 2024 SH0ES measurement?,"**Answer**:

No, the extended cosmological models considered in the ACT DR6 paper do not resolve the tension between the ACT DR6 measurement of H
 and the 2024 SH0ES measurement. The allowed range for H
 from ACT DR6, even with these extended models (66.1 to 71.0 km/s/Mpc), remains below the latest SH0ES measurement of 73.17 ± 0.86 km/s/Mpc.
