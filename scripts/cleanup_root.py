Enhanced SciRAG is a production-ready scientific document processing system that combines the original SciRAG capabilities with advanced RAGBook integration for superior mathematical content handling.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development
```bash
# Run the enhanced processing
./scirag_notebook_env/bin/python test_final_verification.py

# Or use the local server
./scripts/run_local.sh
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Deploy with Docker
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

## 📁 Directory Structure

- `scirag/` - Main SciRAG package with enhanced processing
- `scripts/` - Deployment and utility scripts
- `development/` - Development files organized by phase
- `deployment/` - Production deployment configurations
- `archive/` - Archived development files

## 🔧 Core Features

- **Mathematical Content Processing** - Full LaTeX equation support
- **Intelligent Content Classification** - Automatic content type detection
- **Enhanced Chunking** - Smart chunking that preserves structure
- **Asset Processing** - Figure and table handling
- **Glossary Extraction** - Definition and term extraction
- **Backward Compatibility** - Full preservation of existing SciRAG

## 📊 Status

✅ **All Phases Complete** - Enhanced SciRAG is production ready!
✅ **10/10 Tests Passing** - All functionality verified
✅ **Local Deployment** - Working perfectly
✅ **Docker Ready** - Production deployment available

## 📚 Documentation

- [Production Guide](deployment/PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md)
- [Development History](development/)
- [API Documentation](scirag/api/)
